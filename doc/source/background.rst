Veering triangulations
======================

Veering triangulations were originally defined as 3-dimensional
triangulation of mapping tori in [Ag11]_, see also [Gu09]_, [Gu16]_. It
turns out that they also encode nicely train-tracks splitting sequences of
pseudo-Anosov.

The veerer library implements most of the tools from [BeDeGaGuSc]_ which
shares a lot of ideas with [Ha09]_.
