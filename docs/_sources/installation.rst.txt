Install veerer
==============

To install the module you need Python (version 2 or 3). Computations involving
polytopes are only available if the Python module
`pplpy <https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy>`_ is available. Additional features
are available if used inside `SageMath <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_.

The installation of veerer is done via pip. You first need to clone the
repository (either use git or download the project as a tarball). Then cd to
the directory in a console and run

::

    $ pip install --user .

or to install within SageMath

::

    $ sage -pip install --user .
